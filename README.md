# sportSquads

sportSquads is a space offering users the opportunity to find
other sport enthusiasts and get together to play their favourite
sports.
Every user can choose their favourite sport and create their own
team or join someone elseâ€™s within just a few clicks! The users
can pick the team they best fit in, through their description,
location, and the availability of spots in their preferred role.
Is the sport you are interested not there? You can just add your
own sport category and team for others to join!
No commitment is necessary since every user can drop out and
give a shot to a different team or even sport!
Users can also join an unlimited number of teams through their
account and try new sports along the way
